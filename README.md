# AutoZoom
Opens up Zoom link (or any URL) given a day of the week and a time (in 24 hour time). If run in open terminal, will execute that task weekly. 

# Background
Although this program is simple, it is a straightforward solution to a problem that exists in today's virtual economy. 
- Have a class that overlaps? Type in your URL, time, and day of the week. 
- How about a meeting at 12:30 PM that you can't attend because you're at the gym until 1:00 PM? Don't break a sweat over that; break a sweat in the gym instead!
- What if you oversleep for an early meeting? Set up your terminal the night before, leave open overnight, and you can sleep in for those extra 10 minutes that you deserve.

This program has helped me a lot because I wake up, plan out my day, and run this in my terminal for all of my classes in the event that I can't start my meeting on time.
